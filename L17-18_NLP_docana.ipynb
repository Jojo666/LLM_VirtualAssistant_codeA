      "Summary:\n",
      " Researchers predicted mangrove habitat changes in Guangdong, China consider-forming land-use change . They used MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models to simulate the impact of coastal land use . The models were coupled as an integrated framework for the study . Researchers predicted that 70% of the current trend would remain in 2030 .\n",
      " Global mangrove forests have exhibited distinct changes in the past decades owing to anthropogenic activities . Understanding the inherent con-ﬂicts between conservation/restoration and land-use demands is fundamental for management . A novel integrated framework coupling MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE modeling was proposed . The coupled model can identify suitable mangrove afforestation habitats .\n",
      " The potential habitat of 14 man-specific species under three land-use scenarios were mapped using the combined models . Under the current trend scenario, only 41.2% of the existingwetland would be retained, whereas the potential distribution area of all the man-made species will decrease by an average of 30% .\n",
      " Mangrove ecosystems are distributed along the coasts in tropical and subtropical regions between latitudes of approximately 30° N and 30° S . Mangroves provide valuable ecosystem services by supporting coastal ﬁsheries ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) while yielding commer-giancial forest products .\n",
      " Mangroves are on the verge of extinction in 26 out of the 120 countries with mangroves ( FAO, 2007 ), owing to land use and land cover (LULC) changes from small-scale tree harvesting to clear-cutting for timber .\n",
      " A massive loss of mangrove forests, approximately 1.9 million hectares, has been reported in Asia since 1980 . Reclamation was the main cause of man-grove forest loss, with 97.6% being used to build aquacul-insuredture ponds . In China, a total of 12,924 ha have disappeared between 1980 and 2000 .\n",
      " Only 57% of replanted mangroves have been successfully restored nationwide in China . The Chinese government planned to restore 18,800 haof mangrove by 2025 . The reasons for this include urbanization and reclamation of suitable habitats and improper site selection of restoration projects .\n",
      " Mangrove habitat changes are driven by land-use pressure, the change rates, and the effect of different policies can provide an important scienti ﬁc basis for the formulation of mangrove afforestation strategies . Suitable habitats for mangroves can be mapped using species distribu-ishlytion models (SDMs) SDMs can analyze the relationship between species distribution data and en-naissancevironmental factors through statistical algorithms .\n",
      " Coupling SDMs and land-use change models can address how suitable habitats for man-geygroves interact with future land use changes . These two model types are usually used independently, i.e., either considering natural suitability(Charrua et al., 2020 ;Hu et al, 2020b ) or land pressures ( Sardar and Samadder, 2021 )\n",
      " Guangdong has the largest mangrove distribution area among China's coastal provinces . Study combined an SDM and land-use change-model focusing on Guangzhou Province . Study area is located at 20° 13 ‘N–25° 31 ‘A-N and 109° 39 ‘E’N . The Tropic of Cancer runs through the province .\n",
      " The Gross DomesticProduct (GDP) of Guangdong ranks ﬁrst nationwide with over 115 mil-                lion people ( NBSC, 2020 ), and its coastline (8500 km) covers the northerntropical and southern subtropical temperature zones . There are 14 native true mangrove species, with Avicennia marina,Aegiceras corniculatum,Sonneratia caseolaris and Andelia obovata being the most common species ( Yang et al., 2018 )\n",
      " The proposed approach consists of four steps: (1) dataset-collection and processing, including mangrove presence, environmen-naissancetal, LULC, and socioeconomic data . (2) predicting the potential suitabil-idatedity of mangroves distribution by MaxEnt modeling using the presence-data and environmental variables . (3) simulating the 2030 land-use-use change under three scenarios through Dyna-CLUE modeling; (4) predicting spatial change of habitat by deducting all the arti ﬁcial land use-use types from the theoretically suitable area .\n",
      " Reconnaissance and sam-pling surveys were conducted and combined with historical records to determine the distribution of mangrove species . Thereafter, patches were resampled into points using the Fishnetmethod in ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2, with a sampling resolution of 100 m. n checked through on-site investigations in 2018 –2019 .\n",
      " Temperature, salinity, substrate, and distance from the coastline are important factors affecting the growth and distribution of mangroves . A correlation-analysed analysis of 40 environmental variables was performed . The variables with high correlation (Pearson correlation coef ﬁcient |r| ≥0.8) were re-moved and the less correlated variables were retained .\n",
      " Suitable habitats for mangroves in Guangdong Province were pre-ordered using MaxEnt 3.4.1 ( Phillips et al., 2017 ) MaxEnt estimates the suitability of targeted species by estimating the maximum entropy of the species distribution based on input presence data . 75% of the presence data was randomly selected as training data, while 25% was used as testing data .\n",
      " The Dyna-CLUE model can simulate and predict the spatial layout of land use through quantitative analysis and summarization of the inter-actions among different land covers, and natural, policy, and social fac-naissancetors ( Verburg and Overmars, 2009 ) The model includes two parts: anon-spatial demand module for predicting future land use demand and a space allocation module .\n",
      " Land-use changes are related to various biophysical and socioeco-ethical drivers ( Peng et al. r calculating land use plans . The change rate of each LULC type was calculated using LULC data for 2015 and 2020 . In the intertidal zone, the distri-glybution dataset of the national wetland and coastal aquaculture ponds was used to complete the coastal LULC map .\n",
      " Three scenarios were developed for 2030 according to the current land-use change from 2015 to 2020 . Topographic and socio-economic indices were input into the model as driving factors . All data were resampled to 250 m ( Gong et al.  al., 2020 ).\n",
      " The ecolog-hetical protection scenario (EPS) considered aggressive ecological protection and restoration policy, completely stopping the transfer of natural to arti ﬁcial land types . 50% of the aquaculture area at 0 –6 m water depth would be restored to wetland . The spatial land-use changes of these scenarios were sim-ulated with the Dyna-CLUE model (version 2.0)\n",
      " The distribution of native mangrove species in Guangdong Province, China was assessed using the kappa value, which compared the predicted result with the actual LULC pattern in 2020 (Peng et al., 2020 ). The model accuracy was based on the predicted results of the Science of the Total Environment 788 (2021) 147914 .\n",
      " For each species group, a binary map was generated based on suitability, with a suitability threshold of 0.5 ( Wang et al.,2020b ) Grids with a value of 1 indicated that the area was a potential area for mangroves . Then, the arti ﬁcial land types (cultivated land, urban and indus-fledgedtria) were used to generate a land-use map . Pcis the expected correct simulation ratio under random conditions, calculated from the transi-tion matrix .\n",
      " Theoretical distribution of mangrove habitats was modeled using MaxEnt modeling . G1 and G6 had the widest and narrowest distribution, with an area of 160,513 and 9663 ha, respectively . Species richness decreased with increasing latitude .\n",
      " We screened and listed the top three important variables for each group in Table 4 . The annual precip-inducingitation, SST in the coldest season, and salinity range showed important contributions in most groups . These environmental variables were used to describe the multidimensional niche of each group .\n",
      " The Paci ﬁc Islands Ocean Observing System's Distance to Nearest Coastline ( http://oos.soest.edu/thredds/ncss/dist2coast_1deg_ocean/dataset.html ) Calculated by ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2 according to elevation data .\n",
      " The AUC values for the Dyna-CLUE predictions were 0.54 –0.84, 88% of which exceeded 0.70 ( Table 5 ), indicating that the selected driving fac-ishlytors had strong explanatory power for the conversion of land .\n",
      " The coastal zone of Guangdong is a typical area with rapid socioeco-ethical development and urbanization . Under CTS, aquaculture and urban/industrial land were the main net in ﬂow land types . However, under the alternative policies, land-use transfer patterns showed great changes .\n",
      " Under SDS, the woodland and water areas were maintained at the level they were in 2020 . Under EPS, the wetland area was restored to over three times that in 2015 ( Fig. 6 ) The area of wetland increased signif-ishlyicantly .\n",
      " The suitable areas estimated using MaxEnt described the environ-uvemental limits for the presence of mangrove species . Next, the current and future anthropogenic factors (urbanization, restoration, etc.) were imposed onto the theoretically suitable areas to predict the actual affor-uveestation extent of forests . All arti ﬁcial land types (cultivated land, urban and industrial land, and aquaculture) were deemed suitable .\n",
      " If the current land-use policy is maintained until 2030, the potential distribution area of all mangrove species will decrease by an average of approximately 30% . However, under the other two scenarios, different mangroves showed varied sensi-centricity to conservation and restoration policies . The mangroove distribu-tion area could be increased by 11% –61% depending on the different species groups .\n",
      " Our study estimated the potential suitable habitat of 14 mangrove species in Guangdong Province . According to the Red List of Threat--ishlyened Species of China, A. speciosum and A. ebracteatus in G6 are classi ﬁed as endangered .\n",
      " A. speciosum, B. sexangula, and S. caseolaris lost in their original distribution sites in the 1990s . Aquaculture development was the most important reason for the loss of these species . The mangrove species richness in Guangdong Province decreases with increasing latitude ( Quisthoudt et al., 2012 ;Wu et al. on. 2018 .\n",
      " In Shantou, after years of afforestation practice, most of the existing mangrove species belong to G1- to G7 species . Latitude limitation suggests that owing to tolerance to low temperatures, the success rate of res-ishly-toration may be reduced by transplanting species northward .\n",
      " Land-use pattern in 2015, 2020, and 2030 under three scenarios . CTS, SDS, sustainable development scenario; EPS, ecologica l protection scenario. CTS is current trend scenario; SDS is sustainable development. EPS is the protection scenario of 2030 (ha)\n",
      " Land-use change was the crucial driver of mangrove habitat shrinkage . Under CTS, the continuous expansion of aquaculture, as well as urban and industrial land, led to a signi ﬁcant decrease in man-reviewed habitat .\n",
      " Unmanualized urban expansion is the most important threat for mangroves in developing countries and regions . Urbanization has destroyed more than 30% of the Brazilian. southeastern mangrove. grove forests (ha) The aquaculture area in Hainan Province in-creased in 1966 –2009 .\n",
      " In Honduras, 19.1% of mangroves have been converted to urban areas since 1985 . In Guangdong Province, there was a correlation between the increase in urban regions and the loss of forests . Land-use change not only directly affects the coastal estuarine area, but also disturbs total direct runoff regimes and shifts upstream catchment areas .\n",
      " In Guangdong Province, most mangroves have been isolated by aquaculture and buildings from terrestrial habitats . There-                fore, nature reserves had no choice but to extend their boundaries to low intertidal zones . This reduced the actual protection rate of suitable mangrove hab-                itats after 2000 .\n",
      " The success rate of coastal ﬁshpond farming in southern China is only about 35%, and 30% of aquaculture ponds are currently abandoned . It would be possible to return some of the ponds that cause the most serious disturbance to man-groves, to minimize the impact on the livelihood of local communities .\n",
      " Previous studies on mangrove distribution used a single SDM to ex-plain the in-                plain the impact of natural environmental factors on current man-glyve distribution . However, land use often plays a direct role in the change in the distribution of mangroves . Land-use policies are needed to maintain and recover this group in addition to land-use policy changes .\n",
      " This study proved that MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models can be successfully coupled to the simulation of man-grove distribution change in the future . In the current scenario, the maximum potential habitat was estimated to be 34,531 ha, which is close to the 32,326 ha obtained through the for-repreestry surveys .\n",
      " Land-use patterns were adopted as crucial drivers to predict future changes of mangrove habitats . However, the actual habitat extent was over-estimated because the Maxent model could not identify environ-gianmental heterogeneity within 1 km . The use of the deductive method with higher-resolution land use data could constrain the habitat extent .\n",
      " Long-term survivorship and stable mangrove stands may require more than 10 years . Mangrove forest distribution is not only related to environmental conditions but is also affected by land development, such as land development . Mangrove degradation drivers such as pollution, excavation, and cultivation within the forest were not fully considered .\n",
      " The land-use drivingeffects on different mangrove species were analyzed and compared with the MaxEnt model and Dyna-CLUE model in Guangdong, China . Keeping the policy as CTS will.decrease man . species by approximately 30% will. by approximately . Meanwhile, man-grove distribution areas could be increased by 11% –61% under SDS and EPS .\n",
      " The coupled use of MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models proved to offer insights into spatially explicit outcomes, and could quantify the impacts of different land-use policies on these species .

      " A minimum mapping unit of 1 ha is recommended and that the error increases in regions of disturbance and where narrow-strips or smaller fragmented areas of mangroves are present . Artefacts due to cloud cover and the Landsat-7 SLC-off error are also present in some areas .\n",
      " Through population increases, industrialisation, urban expansion and globalisation, mangroves have been fragmented or degraded . Mangroves are receiving greater recognition for their role in food provision, coastal protection, reserves of biodiversity and as a large carbon store .\n",
      " A fundamental requirement for mangrove protection and restoration is information about current and historical distributions and conditions . Data is critical for informing efforts that support conservation, sustainable management, and restoration of these ecosystems . The FAO have also conducted surveys to estimate global mangroves for 1980, 1990 and 2000 .\n",
      " The maps generated are historical (currently by at least two decades) and are unable to be easily updated and certainly not on a regular (e.g., annual) basis . Rates of mangrove loss can also then not be determined as products from different years are based on different years .\n",
      " The Global Mangrove Watch(GMW) aimed to produce consistent 25 m spatial resolution maps of mangrove extent across their range by generating a baseline map for 2010 . The mapping was confined to locations with conditions considered suitable to support mangroves . The objective of the GMW is to provide the information needed by a wide range of users .\n",
      " Many studies have used Earth Observation (EO) data to map mangrove extent . At a global level, the study of Giri et al. [1]was the first to consider L-band SAR for global assessment of mangroves .\n",
      " Methods adopted have varied . The majority have used Landsat and SAR data, while a few have fused optical data . A significant gap is the lack of studies that have sought to develop and apply a single consistent methodology that is repeatable over large gis .\n",
      " The new global mangrove baseline has been generated using a combination of Synthetic Aperture-Radar (SAR) from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased-Array L-band SyntheticAperture Radar (PALSAR) and optical satellite data from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and ETM+ .\n",
      " Using data acquired in 2010, a baseline map of mangrove extent was generated by integratingALOS PALSAR and a composite of Landsat sensor data and referencing the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 30 m Digital Elevation Model data . A final quality assurance (QA) of the resulting baseline product was then taken through visual assessment and, where appropriate, errors were corrected .\n",
      " A global ocean regions dataset was derived to identify oceanic water bodies . The shoreline dataset was rasterised onto the same pixel grid as the ALOS PALSAR data . Oceanic water was defined as pixels that were 200 pixels ( \u00185000 m) from the defined shoreline .\n",
      " The data was re-sampled or rasterised onto the same 0.8 arc-second pixel grid as the ALOS PALSAR data . For the SRTM data cubic spline interpolation was used, while for other continuous data (e.g., Landsat) a cubic convolution was applied .\n",
      " The ALOS PALSAR dual polarisation (HH+HV) backscatter data used were provided by JAXA and Landsat Composites . The nominal spatial resolution was 25 m (0.8 arc seconds) and data were provided in the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate system . The mosaics are openly available in the public domain .\n",
      " composite images were generated using Landsat sensor data acquired for 2010 . This was particularly the case for certain types of adjoining terrestrial forests and wetlands with similar structure to mangroves . Mangroves were distinct from many of these land covers within the Landsat data .\n",
      " A total of 15,346 Landsat scenes from 1766 row/paths were downloaded using the Google Cloud API (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets/landsat) The images were processed to surface reflectance, cloud masked and topographically corrected using the “Atmospheric and Radiometric Correction of Satellite Imagery’s software .\n",
      " Landsat data were re-sampled to match the 0.8 arc-second pixel grid of the ALOS PALSAR data . A maximum NDVI compositing [ 40,41] processing chain was then applied using RSGISLib [ 25] to generate a single Landsat composite image .\n",
      " The resulting 128 projects were defined by the union of Giri et al. [1]and Spalding et. [2]datasets . The resulting groups were then assessed, with small or large regions merged into larger regions and large regions split when these were deemed too large for computational processing .\n",
      " Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 6 of 19. Researchers used a per-pixel Extremely Randomized Trees classification using Scikit-Learn [ 27] and RSGISLib [ 25] software . An initial water mask was produced us us .\n",
      " A coastal region was defined as the area 20 pixels ( \u0018500 m) on either side of the shoreline with a bathymetry depth of >  100m . Additional regions based on 80 pixels ( ++2000 m) either side and a water occurrence < 80were added to this mask . 100,000 training pixels were then extracted randomly for land and water .\n",
      " The thresholds used for generating the coastal mask were identified through an iterative sensitivity analysis and by visually assessing the resulting maps . Water regions with an area of < 50pixels ( \u001831,250 m2) were assigned to the water class .\n",
      " The distance from the coastal water mask needed to be less than 110% of the 99th percentile of the distance of the mangrove pixels . Within the region defined above, a classification was subsequently performed . The classification was performed using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier, with 100 estimators .\n",
      " The new baseline was classified in two independent steps: first using the ALOS PALSAR and then using Landsat data . The mangrove habitat layer (to be available at http://www.globalmangrovewatch.org) defines the maximum possible extent of habitat .\n",
      " The classification was undertaken using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier . The input variables were ALOS PALSAR HH and HV data (transformed to log unit dB), the ratio of HH/HV, pixel longitude and latitude and the mangrove probability . Training samples were defined through random sampling where 100,000 mangroves and non-mangrove samples were used .\n",
      " The training points were visually checked and edited with reference to Google Earth Imagery as well as the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor imagery . In total, 20 M training points globally were defined globally . The region outside the habitat mask, within which training samples were selected, was defined as < 150pixels ( \u00183750 m) from the . union of the mangrove products .\n",
      " An extensive quality assurance (QA) process was carried out following an automated analysis . The resulting analysis was compiled into a single global product for 2010 on a global product . The Extremely Randomized Trees classifier was applied to generate the final classification .\n",
      " The product was visually checked against the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data as well as contemporary (2010) Google Earth imagery . Where significant errors of omission and commission were identified, polygons were drawn and edits applied . The accuracy assessm. undertaken .\n",
      " The accuracy assessment was undertaken using a customQGIS plugin that guides the operator to each point, providing a simple interface to decide between classes . The imagery used for reference included high resolution Google Earth imagery, custom high-resolution imagery, GMW Landsat image composites and ALOS PALSAR 2010 data .\n",
      " Asia is estimated to account for 38.7% of the world’s mangroves, with Southeast Asia alone 294% . Southeast Asia is the region w.2% (32.2%) of the mangrove . The Americas are estimated to comprise 28.7%, Africa and 295.0% Oceania .\n",
      " Indonesia contains the 297. ith largest area of mangroves (53,278 km2) with Latin America and the Caribbean (previously referred to 298-298) having the similar amounts . Brazil, Australia and Mexico combined contain 22.3% of the world's mangrove .\n",
      " The resulting baseline map gives an estimated total mangrove area in 2010 of 137,600 km2 . Asia is estimated to account for 38.7% of the world’s mangroves, with Southeast Asia alone representing almost a third . The Americas are estimated to comprise 28.7%, and Africa and Oceania 20.0% and 11.9% .\n",
      " Indonesia contains 19.5% of the world's mangroves . Brazil, Australia and Mexico combined contain 22.3% of mangrove areas . The Neotropics region (27,940 km2) and Africa has similar amounts . The accuracy of the classification was 95.3%, with a 99% likelihood that the confidence interval was 4.5–5.0% .\n",
      " GMW mangrove baseline for 2010 and distribution of mangroves in longitude and latitude(WGS-84; epsg:4326) The most common errors observed within the GMW baseline are associated with fine-scale features (e.g., riverine, aquaculture and fine coastal features)\n",
      " Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 11 of 19: A recommended minimum mapping unit of 1 ha (i.e., 8 pixels) for reliable mapping is considered to be the most appropriate for end users . The minimum feature size of objects identifiable within the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data encompassed multiple pixels .\n",
      " The backgroundimagery is the 2010 Landsat composite generated for this study, visualised using the NIR, SWIR and Red wavelength bands . The comparison between the GMW 2010 baseline and the 2000 Giri et al. [1] and Spalding et. [2] datasets was undertaken for the six Ramsar regions .\n",
      " Riau/Jambi in Sumatra, Indonesia: GMW v2.0 baseline; (B) Giri et al. [1] and (C) Spalding et. [2] products demonstrated significant differences between these two products . These differences are, in part, due to errors and missing regions in the products .\n",
      " Spalding et al. [2] often overestimates the overall mangrove extent, although there are also regions of missing data . Oceania region accounts for 7.7% of the world’s mangroves, compared to 11.9% that is denoted in this study .\n",
      " Figures for the region were calculated from datasets downloaded from the UN Ocean Data Viewer (http://data.unep-ishlywcmc.org) Giri et al. [1] (v1.3; released 2015) and Spalding et. [2 ] (v2.0; released 2017)\n",
      " The GMW v2.0 baseline and the Giri et al. [1]product has more detail than the GMW .0 baseline . The Spalding et . [2]product is generalised and overestimates the extent of mangroves in Nicaragua .\n",
      " Our results have yielded an updated global mangrove baseline, with an accuracy in excess of 90% . This new global baseline represents an improvement on existing global maps . This includes the successful mapping of mangroves for areas that were found to be absent in other existing products (e.g., Figure 7)\n",
      " The majority of mangrove area can be found in Asia, with an approximately equal proportion distributed between Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean . Mangrove baseline was derived using publicly open imagery from the ALOS PALSAR and the Landsat sensors .\n",
      " The study has produced a new baseline of global mangrove extent for 2010 . The date of the baseline was driven by the availability of the ALOS PALSAR data . The availability of Landsat data in 2010 is poor with Landsat 5 TM data not available globally, with particular sparsity of data throughout Africa .\n",
      " The 2010 Landsat Composite generated for this study is visualised using the NIR, SWIR and Red wavelength bands . The updated baseline is able to suit the requirements and needs of policy and decision makers, such as wetland managers, government bodies, civil society users and Ramsar Convention contracting parties .\n",
      " The Global Mangrove Watch map represents the extent and distribution for 2010, but is also a baseline from which a monitoring system can be built . Thomas et al. [22]demonstrated a novel “map-to-image” method to update mangrove baselines .\n",
      " The new GMW v2.0 baseline constitutes an ideal basis for such a monitoring system using the Japanese JERS-1 SAR (ca. 1996) and ALOS PALSAR (2007–2010) imagery . Data availability is expected to continue and increase into the future .\n",
      " A minimum mapping unit of 1 ha (i.e., 8 pixels) for reliable mapping was used and advocated . Errors associated with the minimum feature size are particularly evident in areas of disturbance, such as around aquaculture ponds . Future work should focus on determining an optimal year for the production of an optical image .\n",
      " There are some areas where mangroves are known to have been omitted in this version (v2.0) of the GMW dataset, due to satellite data unavailability, including: Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Bermuda (UK), Europa Island (France), Fiji, Fiji, Guam and Saipan (USA), Kiribati, Maldives, Peru (south of latitude S4) and Wallis and Futuna Islands (France) While these are not significant in terms of mangrove extent globally, they will be included in the release of future GMW datasets .\n",
      " The launch of Sentinel-2B is considered a significant opportunity for further improvements . There are also some areas where mangroves are known to have been omitted in this version 415/2.0 of the GMW dataset, due to satellite data unavailability .\n",
      " This study is the first to establish a global baseline map of mangrove extent from Earth . It is based on a globally consistent methodology that is automated and reproducible . The map demonstrated a high degree of accuracy with a 99% accuracy . It will be included in the release of future GMW datasets .\n",
      " 38.7% of mangroves found in Asia, 20.3% in Latin America and the 433-Caribbean . 20% in Africa, 20% of Africa, 11.9% in Oceania, 8.4% in North America and 0.7 % in the European Territories . This new globally consistent baseline can form the basis of an operational mangrove monitoring system .\n",
      " The new global mangrove map demonstrated a high degree of accuracy with a 99% likelihood that the accuracy of the global map was 93.6-94.5% . The baseline has mapped around 137,600 km2 of mangroves with 38.7% found in Asia, 20.3% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 20% in Africa, 11.9% in Oceania, 8.4% in North America .\n",

      "Summary:\n",
      " Change and fragmentation trends of Zhanjiang mangrove forests in southeastern China using multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1977 e2010) Mangrove forests are found in saline coastal environments around the tropical and subtropical coastal environments . Mangroves are among the most productive terrestrial ecosystures in the world .\n",
      " The objective of this work was to characterize the spatio-temporal changes in mangrove distribution and fragmentation patterns in the Zhanjiang NationalMangrove Forest Nature Reserve, Guangdong province of Southern China, from 1977 through 2010 . Results revealed that the mangroves' spatial extent decreased sharply during the period from 1977 to 1991 due to deforestation, particularly shrimp farming . Afterwards, there was acontinuous increase in manigrade extent from 1991 to 2010 due to affore .\n",
      " The mangrove fragmentation trends depicted by the fragmentation model had a high degree of corre-centriclation with the observed areal changes . The recorded dynamics of the local biodiversity(mainly birds) were consistent with the mangroves ecosystem fragmentation trends over time .\n",
      " Mangrove forests, found in saline coastal environ-ments around tropical and subtropical latitudes, are among the most productive terrestrial ecosystems in the world . These forests play an important role in providing ecological and societal goods and services to local communities .\n",
      " Many mangrove communities are currently being subject to disturbances from a variety of sources, including un-controlled encroachment due to increasing populations in coastal areas, various destructive human activities (e.g., chemical spills) in surrounding catchments, tsunamis and other storms . In some regions, due to illegal logging, mangroves have been declining at an alarming rate .\n",
      " Valiela et al. (2001) andWilkie and Fortuna (2003) observed that much of what remains from mangrove deforestation . The mangroves around the world, especially those in the developing regions, are experiencing intense spatio-temporal change . These changes are occurring in response to adjacent coral reefs or tropical forests .\n",
      " China’s mangroves naturally occur along the southeast Chinesecoastlines and in the provinces of Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guanxi, Fujian and Taiwan . Historically, half of China ’s . mangrove-centricwetlands were distributed in Guang-glydong province .\n",
      " China had a total of 23 081.5 ha mangroves in 2008, 39.4% (9084 ha) of which existed in Guangdong province . The establishment of mangrove national reserves since 1997 in the province has led to the establishment of national reserves . Mangrove-oriented studies have been conducted there .\n",
      " Few investigations conducted in Guangdong province were focused on the spatio-temporal changes in mangrove distributions . Such information would be invaluable for assessing the effec-orativetiveness of existing mangroves management approaches . The rates, rates, causes, and consequences of changes have not been adequately documented .\n",
      " Zhanjiang National Mangrove Forest Nature Reserve is the largest national-level natural reserve for mangrove protection in mainland China . The reserve was originally established in 1991, and it was approved for elevatation . The study aims to provide insights, implications, and to link the observed fragmentation trends to the local biodiversity dynamics .\n",
      " Zhanjiang mangrove national natural reserve was recently declared as a Ramsar site in January 2002 . The reserve has a notably rich biodiversity and fauna, and includes 28 species, 139 species, 130 conch species, 133 insect species and 192 bird species . In recent years mangroves have become an attractive hotspot for eco-tourism .\n",
      " Lian-jiang city is located at the southernmost tip of Mainland China on Leizhou Peninsula . The area receives abundant precipitation, with an average annual precipitation of about 1500 mm . The average tidal range is about 2.53 m, and the annual average temperature of the surface sea is about 23.7/C14 .\n",
      " The 2001 mangrove thematic inventory data was compiled by the USGS EROS data center at the University of Maryland and the Global Land Cover Facility . The 2001 data was collected by M. Li et al in Guangdong province, China, to identify land use and disturbances in the two prototype areas, and to collect the administrative histories .\n",
      " The study was published in Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 112 . Data and publications related to mangrove management were also obtained from the Guangdong Provincial Center for Forest . resources Monitoring . The study is based on data taken from 1980 ’s, 1995, 2000 and 2005 .\n",
      " M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 113 was done by radiometrically calibrating the images using the latest published post-launch gain and offset constants . After that, the scenes were corrected and resampled to a pixel size of 28.5 m .using a 2-order polynomial equation built upon a total of 13 ground-level control points .\n",
      " Land use and land cover types for study sites were determined: (1) (2) intertidal zone or sandy area, (3) water, (4) aquafarmfor shrimp and crab growing and (5) non-such (cropland, buildingsand roads)\n",
      " The four-point historical land use data collected from the CAS were not used to assess the accuracies because of their relative coarse resolutions (1 e0.1 million), and the thematic mangrove surveys were also excluded from the validation process . The overall accuracy of the classi ﬁcation and spatial agreement were calculated respectively .\n",
      " Based on the sliding window analysis technique, the forest fragmentation model outlined in Wade et al. (2003) was developed to develop spatially explicit maps depicting six forest frag-mentation components . The missing value class was not allowed to fragment the mangroves in the current analysis .\n",
      " Mangrove fragmentation conditions were linked with changes in biodiversity of the reserve using routinely collected bird popu-centriclation survey data . Each subject forest pixel centered within the moving window was classi ﬁed into one of the six forest fragmentation categories described previously by applying the discriminant rules outlined by Riitters et al. (2000)\n",
      " After 2005, birdishlysurveys were carried out mainly in spring . The number of sampling sessions was proportional to the area of mangrove, intertidal zone and aquafarm at each site . Bird species and numbers seen or heard were recorded for all transects using methods described by Zou et al. (2001)\n",
      " Binoculars and spotting scopes were used for detecting and identifying birds . The overall accuracy of the 2000 and 2010 classi ﬁcation results were at 92.3% and 89.7% respectively . The spatial agreement of mangrove maps was identified at 91.1% for 2000 and 90.3%.\n",
      " Mangrove estimates for Gaoqiao and Yingzai were 145 ha and 53 ha in 1977, 69 ha and 42 ha in 1991, . In 2000, 381 ha and 242 ha in 2005, and 453 ha and 353 ha in 2010, respectively, respectively . Aquaculture areas in the two sites increased during the period 1977 to 2005, then decreased .\n",
      " A large-scale sandy area over Gaoqiao in 1977 was changed into water in 1991 . In 2000, aquaculture increased to 490 ha in Gaoquio and 2439 ha in                Yingzai, then continuously increased to 495 ha and 2526 ha in 2005 . After 1991, there was a clear trend of mangroves expanding into water at both sites .\n",
      " Mangrove mangrove fragmentation maps weregenerated to highlight trends of mangroves fragmentation . Interior and perforated components were abso-                lutely predominant over the other four fragmentation conditions at time points . acceleration in fragmentation occurred during the period 1977 e1991, followed by a gradual deceleration in fragmentation during 1991 eophobic2010 .\n",
      " Satellite-based mangrove mapping affected by the local tidal rhythms . Mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems that typi-ishly dominate the intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical coastlines . The tidal rhythms or periods over a particular place are determined by the lunar calendar (lunar gravity)\n",
      " 2001 mangrove resource thematic inventory in Guangdong province revealed 700.9 ha mangroves existed in Gaoqiao and 388.1 ha in Yingzai . However, there is a big discrepancy between the two sets of statistics .\n",
      " According to the records from the local oceanic observatory, on October 30, 2000, high tide occurred at 7:00 AM with a .tidal height of 5.15 m and low tide of 0.4 m occurred at 5:00 PM . The actual tidal height for the time when the satellite acquired data was about 3.73 m . A number of mangroves, especially the seedstands consisting of young mangrove seedlings, were undoubtedly flooded .\n",
      " The ground data from the thematic survey did not correspond with the date of satellite data classi ﬁed, and there was a time lag of about one year between when the maps were made . It is likely that some mangrove afforestation occurred over the time between when our satellite data were acquired and when the survey was conducted .\n",
      " The thematic survey was implemented from extensive ﬁeld visits . Field manual de-lineations of mangrove patches usually overestimate mangroves due to errors of human vision obstacles . It should also be noted that our satellite-based deriva-reviews resulted from interpreting 30-m resolution spectral images .\n",
      " The LandsatTM sensor was spectrally unable to discriminate these areas because of their relative low crown closure in the dominant context of water . Satellite remotely sensed data acquired at the absolute lowest tides when mangrove mapping is optimal . It is relatively rare that we have access to such data from satellite-based sources .\n",
      " Aerial photography can effectively adapt to the local tidal cycles by selectively targeting acquisitions of data at times of low tide . It is generally easier to work around clouds and atmospheric problems with aerial photographacquisitions . Different mangrove conditions have signi ﬁcant impacts on the distributions of birds such as birds .\n",
      " Interior mangrove edges and perforations have less value where the amount of forest is low ( Soledad and Santiago Santiago, 2005 ;. u (2009) argued that the intact interior mangroves were quite suitable for birds because they should afford better protections against capture than small forest patches. This is especially true because isolation can easily . easily .occur when the mangroove landscape is highly fragmented .\n",
      " The fragmentation model used in this study enabled generation of a suite of spatially explicit fragmentation maps that are effective for assessing mangrove restoration potential . These maps can help to spatially convey decision-makers ’recommendations . Conservation and oceanic management stra-glytegies should always consider the quality of the whole Mangrove landscape and especially the number of different habitats .\n",
      " Zhanjiang Nati is located in one of the East Siberian-Australasian-Australasiaian ﬂways, attracting a variety of migrating birds and resident birds to rest in the region . Through the current analysis, the spatial fragmentation information from the model will be helpful for mangrove landscape management .\n",
      " Mangrove Forest Natural Disorders Reserve is referred to as “the heaven of birds ” and plays an extremely important role in biodiversity conservation . Monitoring the dynamics of bird populations has been routine at the reserve . Changes in bird species and population numbers may be an effective mea--sure of mangrove quantity, quality and fragmentation conditions .\n",
      " Anas crecca, a mangrove-dependent local waterfoul species, went up to 200 Yuan RMB (1 US Dollar equals to 6.3 Yuan . The Cantonese desire to eat the teal has led to a sharp decline in its population in recent years . The teal population has also declined due to the over-feeding of shrimp and crabs being aqua-farmed .\n",
      " Due to diverse beach development programs, mangrove forests have shrunk gradually, leading to a sharp decline in livable habitats during the period 1977 to 1991 ( Figs. 2 and3). Thampanya.et al. (2006) also observed the same phenomenon in Thailand and Thailand .\n",
      " Chinese pond-heron, great egret and black-collared starling populations have increased by 10 e20% . The observed increase is principally attributable to the expansion of mangroves and the observed reduction of fragmentation . Bird survey for Gaoqiao (one of the mangrove study sites) suggests that conservation practice at this site has signi ﬁcantly improved the quality of mangrove habitats and attracted greater numbers of birds .\n",
      " Since 2005, the number of bird species and the total numbers of birds have gradually increased and the individual populations have expanded over time . Wu (2009) conducted a systematic survey on the mangrove forests of Zhanjiang and also found a similar trend in bird numbers as we have presented here .\n",
      " Healthymangrove forests provide adequate breeding and nursing grounds, providing adequate breeding grounds, food and shelter for birds . Analyses of mangroves change and fragmenta-like patterns of the present study are undoubtedly affected by errors in the classi-meter classi ﬁcations .\n",
      " MSS images likely resulted in a ‘lower quality ”classi ﬁcation product as compared with those from TM/ETM scenes with a 30-m resolution . Land use maps were derivedfrom the 1977 land use maps with a spatial resolution of 80 m .\n",
      " The fragmentation model used in the analysis is based on the P-f (connectivity) and the P f(forest area density) The outcomes will be highly related to the connectivity of pixels, which is closely dependent upon the accuracy of the classi ﬁcations . The current analysis was unable to separate the younger mangrove stands from the mature stands .\n",

      " The linkages between mangrove fragmentation and biodi-ishly conservation (mainly birds) were highlighted to emphasize the signi ﬁcance of expanding the distribution of mangroves .

      "Summary:\n",
      " A global predictive model of carbon in mangrove soils was published in 2014 Environ. Res. Res Lett. Lett . It was published by the University of Delaware, School of Delaware School of Marine Science and Policy, 308 Robinson Hall, Newark, DEggie19716, USA .\n",
      " Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO 2emissions . Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive models . Using over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28countries by 61 independent studies, we develop a global predictive model .\n",
      " With our predictive model, weconstruct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolutiongrid (5 arc min) We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00 ± 0.94 Pg C(assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and ﬁnd this stock is highly variable over space . The amount of carbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703 ± 38 Mg C ha                −1) is roughly a 2.6 .6 .\n",
      " Results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatologicalpredictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangroves . The results can also be used as a tool to assess changes in soil carbon .\n",
      " Mangroves contain three to four times the mass of carbon typically found in boreal, temperate, or upland tropical forests . Recent studies point to mangrove conservation as a potentially low-cost option for reducing CO2 emissions .\n",
      " In most mangrove areas of the world, protecting mangroves achieves emissions reductions at a lower cost than reducing emissions elsewhere in the econ-omy. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing andimplementing market-based mechanisms such as carbon off-sets .\n",
      " A key challenge in assessing the carbon bene ﬁts from mangrove conservation is the lack of rigorous spatial estimates . Unlike other tropical forests, the bulk of carbon storage is in biomass . soil carbon comprises 49 –98% of carbon stored in the soil .\n",
      " We use data to estimate global mangrovesoil carbon concentrations (mg C cm                −3) and stocks (Pg C) on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min) Our predictive model is based on soil carbon measurements compiled in the meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003 ) Kristensen et al . and Donato et al. combined include data from over 900 samples collected in 28 countries, which contain 64.4% of global mangouves .\n",
      " We use mangrove soil carbon measurements from meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003), Kristensen et al . Kristensen and Donato et al study the spatial distribution of above-ground biomass . Our predictive model can be helpful in assessing the impacts of climate change onmangrove carbon storage .\n",
      " A total of 932 samples were collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies . We convert soil carbon measurements into bulk den-sity measurements following Donato et al (2011) and Kristensen et al . We then use the soil bulk density to calculate the carbon content in g C per cubic centimeter .\n",
      " For the majority of the soil carbon data, source studies report precise locational data,i.e. latitude coordinates reported to the 0.1 of a degree, and severalvariables describing climate conditions at the sampling loca-tions, and regional indicators . The data are available in the online supplementary materials at stacksiop.org/ERL/9/104013/mmedia .\n",
      " The latitude data are used to calculate distance from the equator, which has been linked to mangrove productivity, and therefore may be an important predictor of soil carbon . Climate variables are from the WorldClim Bioclim data (Hijmans et al 2005)\n",
      " We include regional indicators, where regions are ranked according to the ten biogeographic regions for man-groves developed by Spalding et al (2010) Our model controls for the impacts of unobserved factors on carbon concentration in mangrove soils .\n",
      " Constructing a robust predictive model requires balancing the most variation in the data sample with the model ’s generalizability, i.e. Its ability to predict out of the sample (Babyak 2004 ) We evaluate the alternatives models to predict soil carbon concentrations .\n",
      " The model is estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) We compare the parametric predictive models based on in-sample predictive power and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) We estimate several speci ﬁcations of equation (2), where certain parameters or sets of parameters are constrained to equal zero .\n",
      " ML algorithms offer an alternative to single-equation parametric predictive modeling . They involve computational learning in the model-building process . ML algorithms are especially useful in instances where the relationship between the outcome variable and thepredictors is unknown, as is the case with mangrove soilcarbon concentrations (Kristensen et al 2008 )\n",
      " The relative performance of the two ML algorithms depends on the dataset . We test the out-of-sample predictivepower of each model . We use the estimated models topredict soil carbon concentrations for observations in theremaining 31 studies for each of the 1,000 datasets and cal-culate prediction errors .\n",
      " All models were ﬁtted in MATLAB (2013)version 8.1.0.604 . We begin with a simple constant-only model showing that the mean soil car-uvebon content in our sample is 32.14 mg cm−3(min.ggie13.48 mg cm+3, and max.ggie115 mgcm+3), or approximately an average of 321 Mg (tons) C ha−1in the top meter of soil . We progressively add controls to the model and find climaticvariables are signi שּׁ�cant predictors of mangrove soil carbon .\n",

      " Mangrove forests are tropical trees and shrubs that grow in sheltered intertidal zones . Mapping of mangrove forests is a great challenge for remote sensing because mangroves are submerged by tidal waters . Multi-tide images are often unavailable due to rainy climates and uncertain tidal conditions .\n",
      " The practical roles of MFI were validated by applying it to three mangrove forest sites globally . Practically, after applying the MFI to three global sites, 99–102% of submerged mangroves were successfully extracted by MFI . Although there are still some uncertainties and limitations, the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrumen has great beneﬁts .\n",
      " Remote sensing has been widely used to monitor the distribution of mangrove forests for decades . Remote sensing is essential for monitoring the current and past acreage and condition of these ecosystems . There is an emerging demand for conservation and restoration in mangroves .\n",
      " Mangrove forests located near the shoreline are periodicallysubmerged by tides, especially in regions with high tide and lower mangrove shrubs [ 9,10].Ideally, it is better to use images acquired during low tides; however, such data are difficult to obtain due to uncertainties of local instantaneous tidal conditions .\n",
      " Remote sensing of submerged and emerged aquatic vegetation has been widely studied . Hyperspectral images with numerous narrow and contiguous bands is reliable for studying aquatic vegetation . Yet, Landsat only has one band in the spectral region of near infrared (760–900 nm), which may become less sensitive as water depth increases .\n",
      " Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) sensor has 10–20 m spatial resolution and near infrared bands in near infrared region . Machine-learning algorithms such as random forest, neural network, and support vector machine provide promising accuracy in mangrove forests [ 10,13,29].\n",
      " Normalized Di ulent Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most commonly used index in global vegetation studies . Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the ModiﬁedNormalized Di .ulent Water Index were proposed and widely used for mapping surface water . These indices are insensitive to small variations of the re-ectance of submerged mangrove forests and water .\n",

      " Sentinel-2 MSI images were downloaded from European Space Agency Sentinels meticulouslyScientiﬁc Data Hub . The images were preprocessed with geometric and radiometric corrections at roughly sub-pixel accuracy . After atmospheric correction, all remaining bands wer excluded bands with a spatial resolution of 60 m .\n",
      " The study area, Zhenzhu Harbor, China, is located in Guangxi Province, GuangxiProvince, in the southwest portion of mainland China and the north region of Tonkin Gulf (Figure 1) Study Area is mainly composed of mangrove forests .\n",
      " The Zhenzhu Harbor is a typical area for the study of submerged mangrove forests . The area is diurnal, with an average tidal range of 2.24 m, and the mangroves here are primarily younger shrubs . During local high tide some of the forests were submerged during high tides .\n",
      " Ground surveys were conducted along the coasts of Zhenzhu Harbor in November 2017 . The locations of each sampling point was measured using a global positioning system (GPS), with an error less than 1 m. l of the nearest tide station (Fangcheng Harbor Station, 108.140E, 21.280N) A reference-oriented map was built based on object-oriented methods and visual interpretation .\n",
      " Visual interpretation was performed to classify objects as either mangrove forests or water . A false color composite of MSI Bands 11 (centered 1610 nm), Band 8 (centered 842 nm), and Band 4 (centered 665 nm) was generated . The image analysis program was used to conduct object-oriented classiﬁcation .\n",
      " Using the same techniques as above, mangrove forests were identiﬁed from the high-tide MSI image . Figure 3 shows the distributions of emerged and submerged mangroves . Figure 4 shows the measurements of spectral curves of the water, emerged vegetation and submerged vegetation, generated by Chen et al. (2018; Figure 4A) and Visser et. (2015)\n",
      " Waterbody is characterized by low reﬂectance in near infrared at about700 nm . emerged mangrove has relatively high re�aactance, which make them separable from each other . When submerged vegetation is 43–51 cm below clear water, NDVI value was close to zero .\n",
      " Figure 5 shows the typical spectral curves of water (WB), emerged mangrove forest (EMF), and submerged mangroves (SMF) that are observed on the MSI image . Traditional multispectral satellite sensors could not capture these reﬂectance peaks . Fortunately, the MSI sensor has channels that cover these regions .\n",
      " Remote Sens. urves could be used to distinguish submerged mangrove forests from the water background . The higher reﬂectance in bands 5 (centered 705 nm), 6 (centered . 783 nm), 7.8 (centered 842 nm), and 8A (centered. 865 nm) could be . used to . distinguish submerged vegetation’s .rere﬉ectance at 1.5, 16, and 40 cm below water surface .\n",
      " There are no obvious reﬂectance di erences in bands green, red, and SWIR between submerged vegetation and water bodies [33,34,45]. These indices are not suitable for discerning submerged vegetation from water bodies . The absorption valleys in band 4 (centered.665 nm) and band 12 could be used to form a baseline (Figure 6)\n",
      " Band 8 was excluded because Bands 7 (centered 783 nm) and 8A (centered 865 nm) covered most of its spectra . Band 8A above the baseline, is deﬁned as MFI . Pixels with an MFI value above 0 are recognized as mangrove forests .\n",

      " To compare the ability to distinguish submerged mangrove forests from the water background, the VIs values were calculated . The MFI and Floating Algae Index (FAI) were calculated to 10 times their original values . The boxplots are shown in Figure 7.2, with SMF SMF on the surface, WB on the background . SMF means submerged man grove forest, WB means Water Body .\n",
      " Most of the water pixels are confused with submerged mangrove forests in FAI, NDVI, and NDWI images . MFI values are better separated in an MFI image than other VIs . Three selected sites were chosen to demonstrate the practical utility of our newly formed index (MFI)\n",
      " Locations of mangrove forests are shown in Figure 8 . Table 3 shows the overall accuracy, user’s accuracy, producer’re accuracy, and Kappa coe cient of each site .

      " Figure 10 shows a local MSI image (Figure 10A, captured on 2016-10-17) and a MFI-derived image . Dalhousie Island, India, was chosen as a typical area to validate the performance of the MFI . The extent of mangrove extracted by MFI is 6105 ha (pixels with positive MFI values)\n",
      " The overall accuracy of this mangrove map is 96.8%, with a Kappa coe cient of 0.93.8% . In Dalhousie Island, the MFIvalue of emerged mangroves, submerged mgrove forests, and. water pixels range from 0.11 to 0.25, 0.10 to –0.03, and 0.03 to 0 .25, respectively . Baia do Arraial is located along the south coasts of S ão Lu ís city, Brazil .\n",
      " The overall accuracy of this MFI map is 91.7%, with a Kappa coe cient of 0.83. d; fortunately, these mangrove forests showed positive values in Figure 11B, and the snapshot of Google Earth images conﬁrmed that these places were occupied by low mangroves . In Baia do Arraial, the MFI values of emerged.mangrove forests, submerged mangroove forests, . water pixels, and water pixels range from 0.09 to 0.25, and 0.06 to .09 .\n",
      " The lack of full consideration of tidal conditions would cause misclassiﬁcation between mangrove forests and water background . In LSWI, MNDWI, NDVI, and FAI images 27%, 8%, 19%, and 5% of submerged pixels were mixed with water background during high tides .\n",
      " The FAI was established based on baseline theory, but with one NIR band . However, unlike MFI (completely separated submerged mangrove forest and water), in the FPI image, 5% of submerged Mangrove forests pixels were mixed with water .\n",
      " Theoretically, the MFI concept can be applied to other sensors that contain spectral channels of red, NIR, and SWIR, for example, the Landsat OLI sensor which has a red band ranging from 630 to 690 nm . However, the adaptability of the concept to other remote sensing sensors still requires further examination .\n",
      " The MFI function can identify and detect mangrove forests from water background . However, the MFI was designed based on the reﬂectance peak between red and SWIR . Any other vegetation that contains absorption signatures of chlorophyll in aquatic environment can also be detected .\n",
      " Due to limits in image resolution, a small area of the water could still be classiﬁed as mangrove forests . These uncertainties can lead to overestimation of the MFI . In our application in Dalhousie Island, Sundarbans, India, the bias of MFI is 2% larger .\n",
      " Chen et al. discovered that when submerged vegetation coverage was less than 40%, it is di icated to detect vegetation based on the NIR peak in the spectral reﬂectance curve . Water in mangrove swamps always has high turbidity (0.5 nephelometric turbidity units), typical vegetationreﬁectance was undetectable at a water depth of 1 m.\n",
      " A new vegetation index (MFI) was developed to distinguish mangrove forests from the water background . The MFI is more advantageous in detecting submerged mangroves than the traditional NDVI, LSWI, MNDWI, and FAI indices .\n",
      " Theoretically, 100% of submerged mangrove forests could be extracted from MFI images . Practically, application of the MFI in three global mangroves showed 99% to 102% were successfully extracted . The overall accuracy of classiﬁcation results obtained from the .

Indonesia has the largest area under the man-grove cover scattered across the tropical islands, but the ‘Sundarban mangrove wetland’ is the world’s largest contiguous area .\n",
      " Sundarban ecosystem is a repository of the sediment organic carbon content, varying between 0.92 to 3.29%, resulting in an organic carbon stock of 59.14 Tg within 90 cm of the intertidal sediment . Mangrove and sea grasses constitutes the blue carbon sink, which is larger than most of the terrestrial ecosystems, such as boreal forests and tropical forest types .\n",
      " 54 out of 102 islands at the Indian part of Sundarbans were un-improved human habitation and mangrove forests had been wiped out . The rest of the islands were conserved and the last remaining frontier for enigmatic Royal Bengal Tigers . However, blue carbon stocks are reducing across the Sundarban mangroves ecosystem .\n",

      " All mangroves are evergreen plants that shed leaves throughout the year, unlike deciduous plants . The leaf litter constitutes for increased nutrient-N,P in the soil .

      " The blue carbon pool was found to be highest in the plantation site (S1), followed by S2 with more than 10–15-year-old A. marina strands . The association of the two species and the colonization of the other mangrove species indicates an approximately better ecological health, but a Shannon-Weiner value less than 1.5 for all the sites does indicate a stressed ecosystem that is in need of conservation interventions .\n",

      "Summary:\n",
      " A global predictive model of carbon in mangrove soils was published in 2014 Environ. Res. Res Lett. Lett . It was published by the University of Delaware, School of Delaware School of Marine Science and Policy, 308 Robinson Hall, Newark, DEggie19716, USA .\n",
      " Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO 2emissions . Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive models . Using over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28countries by 61 independent studies, we develop a global predictive model .\n",
      " With our predictive model, weconstruct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolutiongrid (5 arc min) We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00 ± 0.94 Pg C(assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and ﬁnd this stock is highly variable over space . The amount of carbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703 ± 38 Mg C ha                −1) is roughly a 2.6 .6 .\n",
      " Results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatologicalpredictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangroves . The results can also be used as a tool to assess changes in soil carbon .\n",
      " Mangroves contain three to four times the mass of carbon typically found in boreal, temperate, or upland tropical forests . Recent studies point to mangrove conservation as a potentially low-cost option for reducing CO2 emissions .\n",
      " In most mangrove areas of the world, protecting mangroves achieves emissions reductions at a lower cost than reducing emissions elsewhere in the econ-omy. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing andimplementing market-based mechanisms such as carbon off-sets .\n",
      " A key challenge in assessing the carbon bene ﬁts from mangrove conservation is the lack of rigorous spatial estimates . Unlike other tropical forests, the bulk of carbon storage is in biomass . soil carbon comprises 49 –98% of carbon stored in the soil .\n",
      " We use data to estimate global mangrovesoil carbon concentrations (mg C cm                −3) and stocks (Pg C) on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min) Our predictive model is based on soil carbon measurements compiled in the meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003 ) Kristensen et al . and Donato et al. combined include data from over 900 samples collected in 28 countries, which contain 64.4% of global mangouves .\n",
      " We use mangrove soil carbon measurements from meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003), Kristensen et al . Kristensen and Donato et al study the spatial distribution of above-ground biomass . Our predictive model can be helpful in assessing the impacts of climate change onmangrove carbon storage .\n",
      " A total of 932 samples were collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies . We convert soil carbon measurements into bulk den-sity measurements following Donato et al (2011) and Kristensen et al . We then use the soil bulk density to calculate the carbon content in g C per cubic centimeter .\n",
      " For the majority of the soil carbon data, source studies report precise locational data,i.e. latitude coordinates reported to the 0.1 of a degree, and severalvariables describing climate conditions at the sampling loca-tions, and regional indicators . The data are available in the online supplementary materials at stacksiop.org/ERL/9/104013/mmedia .\n",
      " The latitude data are used to calculate distance from the equator, which has been linked to mangrove productivity, and therefore may be an important predictor of soil carbon . Climate variables are from the WorldClim Bioclim data (Hijmans et al 2005)\n",
      " We include regional indicators, where regions are ranked according to the ten biogeographic regions for man-groves developed by Spalding et al (2010) Our model controls for the impacts of unobserved factors on carbon concentration in mangrove soils .\n",
      " Constructing a robust predictive model requires balancing the most variation in the data sample with the model ’s generalizability, i.e. Its ability to predict out of the sample (Babyak 2004 ) We evaluate the alternatives models to predict soil carbon concentrations .\n",
      " The model is estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) We compare the parametric predictive models based on in-sample predictive power and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) We estimate several speci ﬁcations of equation (2), where certain parameters or sets of parameters are constrained to equal zero .\n",
      " ML algorithms offer an alternative to single-equation parametric predictive modeling . They involve computational learning in the model-building process . ML algorithms are especially useful in instances where the relationship between the outcome variable and thepredictors is unknown, as is the case with mangrove soilcarbon concentrations (Kristensen et al 2008 )\n",
      " The relative performance of the two ML algorithms depends on the dataset . We test the out-of-sample predictivepower of each model . We use the estimated models topredict soil carbon concentrations for observations in theremaining 31 studies for each of the 1,000 datasets and cal-culate prediction errors .\n",
      " All models were ﬁtted in MATLAB (2013)version 8.1.0.604 . We begin with a simple constant-only model showing that the mean soil car-uvebon content in our sample is 32.14 mg cm−3(min.ggie13.48 mg cm+3, and max.ggie115 mgcm+3), or approximately an average of 321 Mg (tons) C ha−1in the top meter of soil . We progressively add controls to the model and find climaticvariables are signi שּׁ�cant predictors of mangrove soil carbon .\n",
      " Figure 2(left panel) shows the mean soil carbon by region, and the 95% con ﬁdence intervals around the means . The data show that mangroves in North and Central America are some of the most carbon-rich soils .\n",
      " Model 4 outperforms all other parametric predic-tions explored here in terms of attaining the highest R-squared and lowest AIC . We select it as our preferred parametric prediction model and compare it to the two ML-ML algorithms .\n",
      " The improved ability of ML models to predict out of sample suggests that they offer distinct advantages in modeling mangrove soilcarbon . Of the two ML methods, the bag DT performs better than the boosted DT, so we select it as our preferred MLmodel .\n",
      " Parametric predictive model regression results are based on soil carbon concentration (mg C cm−3) The dependent variable is: soil carbon . The model is based on the assumption that soil carbon is carbon free carbon dioxide (mgC cm+3) An average temperature of 32.139** 31.989** (Degrees C) Average temperature of 7.229** 12.210** Average Temperature of 1.747** 5.399** Coldest quarter temperature of 1,747** Average Precipitation of 0.005** (Millimeters)\n",
      " Using our ML predictive model along with mangrove.egland cover data from Giri et al (2011), we construct a global.comet of estimated soil carbon . carbon concentrations (mg C cm.C cm.2) and stocks (PG C) on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min) Standard errors for all of our estimates are calculated from the standarddeviation of predictions from 10 000 ML models constructedfrom 10 000 random samples (bootstrap samples)\n",
      " Figure 3 maps the predicted soil carbon concentrations for the world ’s mangroves and ﬁgure 4 portrays mangrove soil carbon in Indonesia . Table 4 lists the estimated global and country-level stock for the top-20 countries . Globally, we estimate thatmangrove soils contain 5.00 ± 0.94 Pg C and that about 80.5% of the pool is contained in 20 countries .\n",
      " We estimate that the amount of carbon per hectare in the world’s most carbon-rich mangroves is roughly 2.6 ± 0.14 times that of the world ‘s most . carbon-poor mangrove soil carbon . We also ﬁnd substantial . within-country .variation in soil carbon carbon . The country with the highest average soil carbon concentration has roughly twice the . amount of soil carbon, per . hectare .\n",
      " The 20 countries with highest average soil carbon concentrations contain only 1.2% of the world’s mangroves, but as a consequence of their relatively high soil carbon, these countries account for roughly 1.5% of global mangrove soil carbon .\n",
      " Our results are con-sistent with studies that mangrove productivity increases with temperature up to a threshold . ML algorithms perform substantially better than simple parametric predictions in predicting out ofsample. Therefore, they may offer substantial gains in estimating soil carbon concentrations based on available data .\n",
      " To obtain the highest-quality predictive model given available data, we explored several predictive modelingtechniques and compared their performance along severaldimensions . As with any predictive model, the quality of the predictions depends on the quality . The possibility that soil carbon measurements oversample pristine mangrove locations is speculative about in Kristensen et al (2008 ) and Hutchinsonet al (2013)\n",
      " Researchers develop a model to predict mangrove soil carbon explaining substantial spatialvariation in the carbon concentrations of global mangroves . The relative importance normalizes the relative importance of the model by the sum of importance scores over allpredictors .\n",
      " Using over 900observations collected in 28 countries throughout the world, which represent the majority of global mangroves, we produce a high-resolution and explicitly explicit global dataset of mangrove soil carbon concentrations . These data can help examine current man-grove conservation projects .\n",
      " Mangrove carbon storage varies substantially over space; the bene ﬁts from mangrove conservation depend on the location of the mangroves conserved . This will allow for a more complete understanding of the impacts of climate change .\n",
      " Future work is needed to evaluate the full array of ecosystem services that mangroves provide, such as shoreline protection or the provision of providing nursery habitat for ﬁsh . It is unclear whether the many other bene ­nursery benefits from mangrove conservation are correlated with the potential for carbon offsets . The results can be an important input intothese future comprehensive assessments .\n",
