They provide natural resources to local populations, including food and timber. However, their extent has been reduced through various processes, and many have been degraded or fragmented, particularly in Southeast Asia. Mangroves are increasingly affected by climatic fluctuations, and they are recognized for their role in food provision, coastal protection, biodiversity reserves, and carbon storage. Protection and restoration efforts are being made to ensure their conservation and sustainable management.'}\n"
