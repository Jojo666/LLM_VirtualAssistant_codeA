      "Summary:\n",
      " Researchers predicted mangrove habitat changes in Guangdong, China consider-forming land-use change . They used MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models to simulate the impact of coastal land use . The models were coupled as an integrated framework for the study . Researchers predicted that 70% of the current trend would remain in 2030 .\n",
      " Global mangrove forests have exhibited distinct changes in the past decades owing to anthropogenic activities . Understanding the inherent con-ﬂicts between conservation/restoration and land-use demands is fundamental for management . A novel integrated framework coupling MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE modeling was proposed . The coupled model can identify suitable mangrove afforestation habitats .\n",
      " The potential habitat of 14 man-specific species under three land-use scenarios were mapped using the combined models . Under the current trend scenario, only 41.2% of the existingwetland would be retained, whereas the potential distribution area of all the man-made species will decrease by an average of 30% .\n",
      " Mangrove ecosystems are distributed along the coasts in tropical and subtropical regions between latitudes of approximately 30° N and 30° S . Mangroves provide valuable ecosystem services by supporting coastal ﬁsheries ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) while yielding commer-giancial forest products .\n",
      " Mangroves are on the verge of extinction in 26 out of the 120 countries with mangroves ( FAO, 2007 ), owing to land use and land cover (LULC) changes from small-scale tree harvesting to clear-cutting for timber .\n",
      " A massive loss of mangrove forests, approximately 1.9 million hectares, has been reported in Asia since 1980 . Reclamation was the main cause of man-grove forest loss, with 97.6% being used to build aquacul-insuredture ponds . In China, a total of 12,924 ha have disappeared between 1980 and 2000 .\n",
      " Only 57% of replanted mangroves have been successfully restored nationwide in China . The Chinese government planned to restore 18,800 haof mangrove by 2025 . The reasons for this include urbanization and reclamation of suitable habitats and improper site selection of restoration projects .\n",
      " Mangrove habitat changes are driven by land-use pressure, the change rates, and the effect of different policies can provide an important scienti ﬁc basis for the formulation of mangrove afforestation strategies . Suitable habitats for mangroves can be mapped using species distribu-ishlytion models (SDMs) SDMs can analyze the relationship between species distribution data and en-naissancevironmental factors through statistical algorithms .\n",
      " Coupling SDMs and land-use change models can address how suitable habitats for man-geygroves interact with future land use changes . These two model types are usually used independently, i.e., either considering natural suitability(Charrua et al., 2020 ;Hu et al, 2020b ) or land pressures ( Sardar and Samadder, 2021 )\n",
      " Guangdong has the largest mangrove distribution area among China's coastal provinces . Study combined an SDM and land-use change-model focusing on Guangzhou Province . Study area is located at 20° 13 ‘N–25° 31 ‘A-N and 109° 39 ‘E’N . The Tropic of Cancer runs through the province .\n",
      " The Gross DomesticProduct (GDP) of Guangdong ranks ﬁrst nationwide with over 115 mil-                lion people ( NBSC, 2020 ), and its coastline (8500 km) covers the northerntropical and southern subtropical temperature zones . There are 14 native true mangrove species, with Avicennia marina,Aegiceras corniculatum,Sonneratia caseolaris and Andelia obovata being the most common species ( Yang et al., 2018 )\n",
      " The proposed approach consists of four steps: (1) dataset-collection and processing, including mangrove presence, environmen-naissancetal, LULC, and socioeconomic data . (2) predicting the potential suitabil-idatedity of mangroves distribution by MaxEnt modeling using the presence-data and environmental variables . (3) simulating the 2030 land-use-use change under three scenarios through Dyna-CLUE modeling; (4) predicting spatial change of habitat by deducting all the arti ﬁcial land use-use types from the theoretically suitable area .\n",
      " Reconnaissance and sam-pling surveys were conducted and combined with historical records to determine the distribution of mangrove species . Thereafter, patches were resampled into points using the Fishnetmethod in ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2, with a sampling resolution of 100 m. n checked through on-site investigations in 2018 –2019 .\n",
      " Temperature, salinity, substrate, and distance from the coastline are important factors affecting the growth and distribution of mangroves . A correlation-analysed analysis of 40 environmental variables was performed . The variables with high correlation (Pearson correlation coef ﬁcient |r| ≥0.8) were re-moved and the less correlated variables were retained .\n",
      " Suitable habitats for mangroves in Guangdong Province were pre-ordered using MaxEnt 3.4.1 ( Phillips et al., 2017 ) MaxEnt estimates the suitability of targeted species by estimating the maximum entropy of the species distribution based on input presence data . 75% of the presence data was randomly selected as training data, while 25% was used as testing data .\n",
      " The Dyna-CLUE model can simulate and predict the spatial layout of land use through quantitative analysis and summarization of the inter-actions among different land covers, and natural, policy, and social fac-naissancetors ( Verburg and Overmars, 2009 ) The model includes two parts: anon-spatial demand module for predicting future land use demand and a space allocation module .\n",
      " Land-use changes are related to various biophysical and socioeco-ethical drivers ( Peng et al. r calculating land use plans . The change rate of each LULC type was calculated using LULC data for 2015 and 2020 . In the intertidal zone, the distri-glybution dataset of the national wetland and coastal aquaculture ponds was used to complete the coastal LULC map .\n",
      " Three scenarios were developed for 2030 according to the current land-use change from 2015 to 2020 . Topographic and socio-economic indices were input into the model as driving factors . All data were resampled to 250 m ( Gong et al.  al., 2020 ).\n",
      " The ecolog-hetical protection scenario (EPS) considered aggressive ecological protection and restoration policy, completely stopping the transfer of natural to arti ﬁcial land types . 50% of the aquaculture area at 0 –6 m water depth would be restored to wetland . The spatial land-use changes of these scenarios were sim-ulated with the Dyna-CLUE model (version 2.0)\n",
      " The distribution of native mangrove species in Guangdong Province, China was assessed using the kappa value, which compared the predicted result with the actual LULC pattern in 2020 (Peng et al., 2020 ). The model accuracy was based on the predicted results of the Science of the Total Environment 788 (2021) 147914 .\n",
      " For each species group, a binary map was generated based on suitability, with a suitability threshold of 0.5 ( Wang et al.,2020b ) Grids with a value of 1 indicated that the area was a potential area for mangroves . Then, the arti ﬁcial land types (cultivated land, urban and indus-fledgedtria) were used to generate a land-use map . Pcis the expected correct simulation ratio under random conditions, calculated from the transi-tion matrix .\n",
      " Theoretical distribution of mangrove habitats was modeled using MaxEnt modeling . G1 and G6 had the widest and narrowest distribution, with an area of 160,513 and 9663 ha, respectively . Species richness decreased with increasing latitude .\n",
      " We screened and listed the top three important variables for each group in Table 4 . The annual precip-inducingitation, SST in the coldest season, and salinity range showed important contributions in most groups . These environmental variables were used to describe the multidimensional niche of each group .\n",
      " The Paci ﬁc Islands Ocean Observing System's Distance to Nearest Coastline ( http://oos.soest.edu/thredds/ncss/dist2coast_1deg_ocean/dataset.html ) Calculated by ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2 according to elevation data .\n",
      " The AUC values for the Dyna-CLUE predictions were 0.54 –0.84, 88% of which exceeded 0.70 ( Table 5 ), indicating that the selected driving fac-ishlytors had strong explanatory power for the conversion of land .\n",
      " The coastal zone of Guangdong is a typical area with rapid socioeco-ethical development and urbanization . Under CTS, aquaculture and urban/industrial land were the main net in ﬂow land types . However, under the alternative policies, land-use transfer patterns showed great changes .\n",
      " Under SDS, the woodland and water areas were maintained at the level they were in 2020 . Under EPS, the wetland area was restored to over three times that in 2015 ( Fig. 6 ) The area of wetland increased signif-ishlyicantly .\n",
      " The suitable areas estimated using MaxEnt described the environ-uvemental limits for the presence of mangrove species . Next, the current and future anthropogenic factors (urbanization, restoration, etc.) were imposed onto the theoretically suitable areas to predict the actual affor-uveestation extent of forests . All arti ﬁcial land types (cultivated land, urban and industrial land, and aquaculture) were deemed suitable .\n",
      " If the current land-use policy is maintained until 2030, the potential distribution area of all mangrove species will decrease by an average of approximately 30% . However, under the other two scenarios, different mangroves showed varied sensi-centricity to conservation and restoration policies . The mangroove distribu-tion area could be increased by 11% –61% depending on the different species groups .\n",
      " Our study estimated the potential suitable habitat of 14 mangrove species in Guangdong Province . According to the Red List of Threat--ishlyened Species of China, A. speciosum and A. ebracteatus in G6 are classi ﬁed as endangered .\n",
      " A. speciosum, B. sexangula, and S. caseolaris lost in their original distribution sites in the 1990s . Aquaculture development was the most important reason for the loss of these species . The mangrove species richness in Guangdong Province decreases with increasing latitude ( Quisthoudt et al., 2012 ;Wu et al. on. 2018 .\n",
      " In Shantou, after years of afforestation practice, most of the existing mangrove species belong to G1- to G7 species . Latitude limitation suggests that owing to tolerance to low temperatures, the success rate of res-ishly-toration may be reduced by transplanting species northward .\n",
      " Land-use pattern in 2015, 2020, and 2030 under three scenarios . CTS, SDS, sustainable development scenario; EPS, ecologica l protection scenario. CTS is current trend scenario; SDS is sustainable development. EPS is the protection scenario of 2030 (ha)\n",
      " Land-use change was the crucial driver of mangrove habitat shrinkage . Under CTS, the continuous expansion of aquaculture, as well as urban and industrial land, led to a signi ﬁcant decrease in man-reviewed habitat .\n",
      " Unmanualized urban expansion is the most important threat for mangroves in developing countries and regions . Urbanization has destroyed more than 30% of the Brazilian. southeastern mangrove. grove forests (ha) The aquaculture area in Hainan Province in-creased in 1966 –2009 .\n",
      " In Honduras, 19.1% of mangroves have been converted to urban areas since 1985 . In Guangdong Province, there was a correlation between the increase in urban regions and the loss of forests . Land-use change not only directly affects the coastal estuarine area, but also disturbs total direct runoff regimes and shifts upstream catchment areas .\n",
      " In Guangdong Province, most mangroves have been isolated by aquaculture and buildings from terrestrial habitats . There-                fore, nature reserves had no choice but to extend their boundaries to low intertidal zones . This reduced the actual protection rate of suitable mangrove hab-                itats after 2000 .\n",
      " The success rate of coastal ﬁshpond farming in southern China is only about 35%, and 30% of aquaculture ponds are currently abandoned . It would be possible to return some of the ponds that cause the most serious disturbance to man-groves, to minimize the impact on the livelihood of local communities .\n",
      " Previous studies on mangrove distribution used a single SDM to ex-plain the in-                plain the impact of natural environmental factors on current man-glyve distribution . However, land use often plays a direct role in the change in the distribution of mangroves . Land-use policies are needed to maintain and recover this group in addition to land-use policy changes .\n",
      " This study proved that MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models can be successfully coupled to the simulation of man-grove distribution change in the future . In the current scenario, the maximum potential habitat was estimated to be 34,531 ha, which is close to the 32,326 ha obtained through the for-repreestry surveys .\n",
      " Land-use patterns were adopted as crucial drivers to predict future changes of mangrove habitats . However, the actual habitat extent was over-estimated because the Maxent model could not identify environ-gianmental heterogeneity within 1 km . The use of the deductive method with higher-resolution land use data could constrain the habitat extent .\n",
      " Long-term survivorship and stable mangrove stands may require more than 10 years . Mangrove forest distribution is not only related to environmental conditions but is also affected by land development, such as land development . Mangrove degradation drivers such as pollution, excavation, and cultivation within the forest were not fully considered .\n",
      " The land-use drivingeffects on different mangrove species were analyzed and compared with the MaxEnt model and Dyna-CLUE model in Guangdong, China . Keeping the policy as CTS will.decrease man . species by approximately 30% will. by approximately . Meanwhile, man-grove distribution areas could be increased by 11% –61% under SDS and EPS .\n",
      " The coupled use of MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models proved to offer insights into spatially explicit outcomes, and could quantify the impacts of different land-use policies on these species . The authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in this paper .\n",

      "Summary:\n",
      " The Global Mangrove Watch is a new 2010 Global Baseline of Mangroves Extent . The study was conducted by Pete Bunting, Ake Rosenqvist, Richard M. Lucas, Lisa-Maria Rebelo and L. Lammert Hilarides .\n",
      " This study presents a new global baseline of mangrove extent for 2010 and has been released as the first output of the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) initiative . This is the first study to apply a globally consistent and automated method for mapping mangroves .\n",
      " Asia has the highest proportion of mangroves with 38.7% of the global total, while Latin America and the Caribbean have 20.3%, Africa has 20.0%, Oceania has 11.9%, North America has 8.4% and the European Overseas Territories have 0.7%.\n",
      " A minimum mapping unit of 1 ha is recommended and that the error increases in regions of disturbance and where narrow-strips or smaller fragmented areas of mangroves are present . Artefacts due to cloud cover and the Landsat-7 SLC-off error are also present in some areas .\n",
      " Through population increases, industrialisation, urban expansion and globalisation, mangroves have been fragmented or degraded . Mangroves are receiving greater recognition for their role in food provision, coastal protection, reserves of biodiversity and as a large carbon store .\n",
      " A fundamental requirement for mangrove protection and restoration is information about current and historical distributions and conditions . Data is critical for informing efforts that support conservation, sustainable management, and restoration of these ecosystems . The FAO have also conducted surveys to estimate global mangroves for 1980, 1990 and 2000 .\n",
      " The maps generated are historical (currently by at least two decades) and are unable to be easily updated and certainly not on a regular (e.g., annual) basis . Rates of mangrove loss can also then not be determined as products from different years are based on different years .\n",
      " The Global Mangrove Watch(GMW) aimed to produce consistent 25 m spatial resolution maps of mangrove extent across their range by generating a baseline map for 2010 . The mapping was confined to locations with conditions considered suitable to support mangroves . The objective of the GMW is to provide the information needed by a wide range of users .\n",
      " Many studies have used Earth Observation (EO) data to map mangrove extent . At a global level, the study of Giri et al. [1]was the first to consider L-band SAR for global assessment of mangroves .\n",
      " Methods adopted have varied . The majority have used Landsat and SAR data, while a few have fused optical data . A significant gap is the lack of studies that have sought to develop and apply a single consistent methodology that is repeatable over large gis .\n",
      " The new global mangrove baseline has been generated using a combination of Synthetic Aperture-Radar (SAR) from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased-Array L-band SyntheticAperture Radar (PALSAR) and optical satellite data from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and ETM+ .\n",
      " Using data acquired in 2010, a baseline map of mangrove extent was generated by integratingALOS PALSAR and a composite of Landsat sensor data and referencing the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 30 m Digital Elevation Model data . A final quality assurance (QA) of the resulting baseline product was then taken through visual assessment and, where appropriate, errors were corrected .\n",
      " A global ocean regions dataset was derived to identify oceanic water bodies . The shoreline dataset was rasterised onto the same pixel grid as the ALOS PALSAR data . Oceanic water was defined as pixels that were 200 pixels ( \u00185000 m) from the defined shoreline .\n",
      " The data was re-sampled or rasterised onto the same 0.8 arc-second pixel grid as the ALOS PALSAR data . For the SRTM data cubic spline interpolation was used, while for other continuous data (e.g., Landsat) a cubic convolution was applied .\n",
      " The ALOS PALSAR dual polarisation (HH+HV) backscatter data used were provided by JAXA and Landsat Composites . The nominal spatial resolution was 25 m (0.8 arc seconds) and data were provided in the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate system . The mosaics are openly available in the public domain .\n",
      " composite images were generated using Landsat sensor data acquired for 2010 . This was particularly the case for certain types of adjoining terrestrial forests and wetlands with similar structure to mangroves . Mangroves were distinct from many of these land covers within the Landsat data .\n",
      " A total of 15,346 Landsat scenes from 1766 row/paths were downloaded using the Google Cloud API (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets/landsat) The images were processed to surface reflectance, cloud masked and topographically corrected using the “Atmospheric and Radiometric Correction of Satellite Imagery’s software .\n",
      " Landsat data were re-sampled to match the 0.8 arc-second pixel grid of the ALOS PALSAR data . A maximum NDVI compositing [ 40,41] processing chain was then applied using RSGISLib [ 25] to generate a single Landsat composite image .\n",
      " The resulting 128 projects were defined by the union of Giri et al. [1]and Spalding et. [2]datasets . The resulting groups were then assessed, with small or large regions merged into larger regions and large regions split when these were deemed too large for computational processing .\n",
      " Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 6 of 19. Researchers used a per-pixel Extremely Randomized Trees classification using Scikit-Learn [ 27] and RSGISLib [ 25] software . An initial water mask was produced us us .\n",
      " A coastal region was defined as the area 20 pixels ( \u0018500 m) on either side of the shoreline with a bathymetry depth of >  100m . Additional regions based on 80 pixels ( ++2000 m) either side and a water occurrence < 80were added to this mask . 100,000 training pixels were then extracted randomly for land and water .\n",
      " The thresholds used for generating the coastal mask were identified through an iterative sensitivity analysis and by visually assessing the resulting maps . Water regions with an area of < 50pixels ( \u001831,250 m2) were assigned to the water class .\n",
      " The distance from the coastal water mask needed to be less than 110% of the 99th percentile of the distance of the mangrove pixels . Within the region defined above, a classification was subsequently performed . The classification was performed using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier, with 100 estimators .\n",
      " The new baseline was classified in two independent steps: first using the ALOS PALSAR and then using Landsat data . The mangrove habitat layer (to be available at http://www.globalmangrovewatch.org) defines the maximum possible extent of habitat .\n",
      " The classification was undertaken using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier . The input variables were ALOS PALSAR HH and HV data (transformed to log unit dB), the ratio of HH/HV, pixel longitude and latitude and the mangrove probability . Training samples were defined through random sampling where 100,000 mangroves and non-mangrove samples were used .\n",
      " The training points were visually checked and edited with reference to Google Earth Imagery as well as the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor imagery . In total, 20 M training points globally were defined globally . The region outside the habitat mask, within which training samples were selected, was defined as < 150pixels ( \u00183750 m) from the . union of the mangrove products .\n",
      " An extensive quality assurance (QA) process was carried out following an automated analysis . The resulting analysis was compiled into a single global product for 2010 on a global product . The Extremely Randomized Trees classifier was applied to generate the final classification .\n",
      " The product was visually checked against the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data as well as contemporary (2010) Google Earth imagery . Where significant errors of omission and commission were identified, polygons were drawn and edits applied . The accuracy assessm. undertaken .\n",
      " The accuracy assessment was undertaken using a customQGIS plugin that guides the operator to each point, providing a simple interface to decide between classes . The imagery used for reference included high resolution Google Earth imagery, custom high-resolution imagery, GMW Landsat image composites and ALOS PALSAR 2010 data .\n",
      " Asia is estimated to account for 38.7% of the world’s mangroves, with Southeast Asia alone 294% . Southeast Asia is the region w.2% (32.2%) of the mangrove . The Americas are estimated to comprise 28.7%, Africa and 295.0% Oceania .\n",
      " Indonesia contains the 297. ith largest area of mangroves (53,278 km2) with Latin America and the Caribbean (previously referred to 298-298) having the similar amounts . Brazil, Australia and Mexico combined contain 22.3% of the world's mangrove .\n",
      " The resulting baseline map gives an estimated total mangrove area in 2010 of 137,600 km2 . Asia is estimated to account for 38.7% of the world’s mangroves, with Southeast Asia alone representing almost a third . The Americas are estimated to comprise 28.7%, and Africa and Oceania 20.0% and 11.9% .\n",
      " Indonesia contains 19.5% of the world's mangroves . Brazil, Australia and Mexico combined contain 22.3% of mangrove areas . The Neotropics region (27,940 km2) and Africa has similar amounts . The accuracy of the classification was 95.3%, with a 99% likelihood that the confidence interval was 4.5–5.0% .\n",
      " GMW mangrove baseline for 2010 and distribution of mangroves in longitude and latitude(WGS-84; epsg:4326) The most common errors observed within the GMW baseline are associated with fine-scale features (e.g., riverine, aquaculture and fine coastal features)\n",
      " Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 11 of 19: A recommended minimum mapping unit of 1 ha (i.e., 8 pixels) for reliable mapping is considered to be the most appropriate for end users . The minimum feature size of objects identifiable within the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data encompassed multiple pixels .\n",
      " The backgroundimagery is the 2010 Landsat composite generated for this study, visualised using the NIR, SWIR and Red wavelength bands . The comparison between the GMW 2010 baseline and the 2000 Giri et al. [1] and Spalding et. [2] datasets was undertaken for the six Ramsar regions .\n",
      " Riau/Jambi in Sumatra, Indonesia: GMW v2.0 baseline; (B) Giri et al. [1] and (C) Spalding et. [2] products demonstrated significant differences between these two products . These differences are, in part, due to errors and missing regions in the products .\n",
      " Spalding et al. [2] often overestimates the overall mangrove extent, although there are also regions of missing data . Oceania region accounts for 7.7% of the world’s mangroves, compared to 11.9% that is denoted in this study .\n",
      " Figures for the region were calculated from datasets downloaded from the UN Ocean Data Viewer (http://data.unep-ishlywcmc.org) Giri et al. [1] (v1.3; released 2015) and Spalding et. [2 ] (v2.0; released 2017)\n",
      " The GMW v2.0 baseline and the Giri et al. [1]product has more detail than the GMW .0 baseline . The Spalding et . [2]product is generalised and overestimates the extent of mangroves in Nicaragua .\n",
      " Our results have yielded an updated global mangrove baseline, with an accuracy in excess of 90% . This new global baseline represents an improvement on existing global maps . This includes the successful mapping of mangroves for areas that were found to be absent in other existing products (e.g., Figure 7)\n",
      " The majority of mangrove area can be found in Asia, with an approximately equal proportion distributed between Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean . Mangrove baseline was derived using publicly open imagery from the ALOS PALSAR and the Landsat sensors .\n",
      " The study has produced a new baseline of global mangrove extent for 2010 . The date of the baseline was driven by the availability of the ALOS PALSAR data . The availability of Landsat data in 2010 is poor with Landsat 5 TM data not available globally, with particular sparsity of data throughout Africa .\n",
      " The 2010 Landsat Composite generated for this study is visualised using the NIR, SWIR and Red wavelength bands . The updated baseline is able to suit the requirements and needs of policy and decision makers, such as wetland managers, government bodies, civil society users and Ramsar Convention contracting parties .\n",
      " The Global Mangrove Watch map represents the extent and distribution for 2010, but is also a baseline from which a monitoring system can be built . Thomas et al. [22]demonstrated a novel “map-to-image” method to update mangrove baselines .\n",
      " The new GMW v2.0 baseline constitutes an ideal basis for such a monitoring system using the Japanese JERS-1 SAR (ca. 1996) and ALOS PALSAR (2007–2010) imagery . Data availability is expected to continue and increase into the future .\n",
      " A minimum mapping unit of 1 ha (i.e., 8 pixels) for reliable mapping was used and advocated . Errors associated with the minimum feature size are particularly evident in areas of disturbance, such as around aquaculture ponds . Future work should focus on determining an optimal year for the production of an optical image .\n",
      " There are some areas where mangroves are known to have been omitted in this version (v2.0) of the GMW dataset, due to satellite data unavailability, including: Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Bermuda (UK), Europa Island (France), Fiji, Fiji, Guam and Saipan (USA), Kiribati, Maldives, Peru (south of latitude S4) and Wallis and Futuna Islands (France) While these are not significant in terms of mangrove extent globally, they will be included in the release of future GMW datasets .\n",
      " The launch of Sentinel-2B is considered a significant opportunity for further improvements . There are also some areas where mangroves are known to have been omitted in this version 415/2.0 of the GMW dataset, due to satellite data unavailability .\n",
      " This study is the first to establish a global baseline map of mangrove extent from Earth . It is based on a globally consistent methodology that is automated and reproducible . The map demonstrated a high degree of accuracy with a 99% accuracy . It will be included in the release of future GMW datasets .\n",
      " 38.7% of mangroves found in Asia, 20.3% in Latin America and the 433-Caribbean . 20% in Africa, 20% of Africa, 11.9% in Oceania, 8.4% in North America and 0.7 % in the European Territories . This new globally consistent baseline can form the basis of an operational mangrove monitoring system .\n",
      " The new global mangrove map demonstrated a high degree of accuracy with a 99% likelihood that the accuracy of the global map was 93.6-94.5% . The baseline has mapped around 137,600 km2 of mangroves with 38.7% found in Asia, 20.3% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 20% in Africa, 11.9% in Oceania, 8.4% in North America .\n",

      " This project was undertaken in part within the framework of the JAXA Kyoto & CarbonInitiative . SuperComputing Wales (SCW) are also thanked for supporting the project through the provision of the HighPerformance Computing (HPC) facility on which all the data were analysed .\n",
